# majournal

Journal while programming.

## Why Fork

This was forked because while [the original](https://github.com/groktools/journal) worked, it wasn't as simple as I'd like it to be. This has one command and works with multiple project roots open in a single window.

## Installation

You can install directly from GitHub using the following command:

```sh
apm install malonehedges/majournal
```

Installing from the official directory is coming soon.

## Usage

Use the key command or activate it from the Command Palette.
